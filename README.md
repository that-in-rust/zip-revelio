# 🔍 ZIP-REVELIO

Ever wanted to peek inside a huge ZIP file without waiting forever? That's exactly what ZIP-REVELIO does!

```ascii
ZIP File (4GB)     ZIP-REVELIO        Analysis Report
   ┌─────┐         ┌─────────┐         ┌─────────┐
   │.zip │   →     │⚡ 23MB/s│    →    │📊 Stats │
   └─────┘         └─────────┘         └─────────┘
     Input         Processing           Output
```

## 🎯 What's Cool About It?

Think of it as a super-fast ZIP file detective:
```rust
// Real example of what it does:
let huge_zip = "your-4gb-file.zip";
println!("ZIP-REVELIO: Let me check that file for you!");
// [....] Processing at 23.5 MB/s
println!("Found: 1,337 files (1.31 GB total)");
println!("They're compressed down to 445 MB (66% smaller!)");
```

## 🚀 Try It Yourself!

It's as simple as:
```bash
# Just point it at your ZIP file
cargo run -- your-file.zip report.txt

# For example:
cargo run -- /home/downloads/node-main.zip node-main-analysis.txt
#            |                          |
#            Your ZIP file             Where to save the report
```
