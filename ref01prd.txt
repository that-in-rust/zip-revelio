# Parallel ZIP File Analyzer - PRD

Core Requirements ðŸŽ¯

1. CLI tool to analyze a single ZIP file using parallel processing
2. Uses tokio for async I/O and rayon for parallel decompression
3. Outputs analysis to a text file
4. Shows progress bar during analysis
5. Handles ZIP files efficiently:
   - Fixed 4MB chunks for optimal performance
   - Supports both ZIP32 and ZIP64 formats
   - Skips non-ASCII filenames (for compatibility)
   - Supports Store/Deflate compression methods
6. Provides detailed file statistics and compression info
7. Maintains memory efficiency through fixed 4MB chunks
8. Graceful error handling
9. Simple CLI: `cargo run -- input.zip output.txt`

Example Report Format:
```

/path/to/file1.zip
/path/to/file2.zip
/path/to/file3.zip
/path/to/file4.zip
/path/to/file5.zip
/path/to/file6.zip
```

e.g.
1.
cargo run -- /home/amuldotexe/Downloads/node-main.zip /home/amuldotexe/Downloads/node-main-20241105v2.txt

Constraints:
