I want you to ELI15 explain visually in the style of @visualASCII202410.txt  in @prd.txt  why you took the module design that you thought of

Do not touch Section

Start from Section 2

Explain your thought process, data flow, information flow, whatever that is with your 300 IQ

Based on @ref01prd.txt  please have a look at @ref02archL1.txt  - it is supposed to be built in the style of @visualASCII202410.txt 

It should have the information on how are we thinking about the problem and what are the big rocks, big dependencies, big pieces of code etc
