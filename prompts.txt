I want you to ELI15 explain visually in the style of @visualASCII202410.txt  in @prd.txt  why you took the module design that you thought of

Do not touch Section

Start from Section 2

Explain your thought process, data flow, information flow, whatever that is with your 300 IQ

Based on @ref01prd.txt  please have a look at @ref02archL1.txt  - it is supposed to be built in the style of @visualASCII202410.txt 

It should have the information on how are we thinking about the problem and what are the big rocks, big dependencies, big pieces of code etc 

Can you make even more TDD driven minimalistic architecture in @ref02architL1.txt  in style of @visualASCII202410.txt  - which aligns with MVP of @ref01prd.txt
